# Frequent-ItemSet-Analysis-On-Amazon-Metadata

This project implements a real-time product recommendation system for Amazon products using the amazon_metadata dataset. The system leverages streaming data processing techniques to analyze product information and discover frequent itemsets, ultimately suggesting relevant products to customers . 


##### This README provides an overview of the project, including:

_1.Dataset:_ Description of the amazon_metadata dataset and its structure.

_2.Pre-processing:_ Steps involved in cleaning and formatting the data for streaming analysis.

_3.Streaming Pipeline:_ Design of the streaming pipeline with a producer application and multiple consumer applications.

_4.Frequent Itemset Mining:_ Implementation of Apriori and PCY algorithms within consumers to identify frequently co-purchased items.

_5.Database Integration:_ Integration with a NoSQL database (recommended: MongoDB) to store the discovered frequent itemsets.

_6.Bonus:_ Bash Script (Optional): Setting up a bash script to automate the execution of producers, consumers, and Kafka components.

This project aims to showcase the application of frequent itemset mining algorithms in a streaming context for real-time product recommendations.
